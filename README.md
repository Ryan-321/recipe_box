# Recipe Box:

  Is a recipe sharing app, were people will be able to digitally store and search
  through there own recipes, as well as those of others and leave comments on those recipes.  I also have two static pages,
  one which users can look up the temperatures of the doneness of various meats and one, unfinished, but will
  convert liquid and weight measurements from user input.

# Technologies:

  Built this app with a full-stack of HTML, CSS, Jquery and Ruby on Rails.  This is my first Rails application
  so I kept it pretty simple, more just experimenting along the way with the code and trying to familiarize
  myself with Rails.  I wrote out the CSS myself for the layout and the User Authorization for Ruby.  I did use the   BCrypt Gem for password protection.  

# Approach:

  Trying to write most of the code myself to learn Rails and keep my GEMS to a minimum.  I wanted to get a firm
  understanding of the flow of Rails before I started to add some GEMS.  

# Unsolved Issues:

  I need to finish my 2nd static page the converter.  Also, I need to update
  the user authentication so that user's can only update and edit their own recipes.
  This proved challenging without GEMS.
